## Project Overview
This project addresses a practical and highly relevant business problem in the logistics and e-commerce sector: maximizing the daily profit of a warehouse operation under real-world constraints. As e-commerce continues to grow, efficient warehouse management has become a critical factor for business success. The core challenge is to determine the optimal allocation of warehouse resources—space, labor, and delivery capacity—among multiple product categories, each with unique space, handling, and profit characteristics.

Our solution leverages linear programming, a mathematical optimization technique, and the Python PuLP library to model and solve this problem. The approach is designed to be transparent, reproducible, and easily adaptable to other warehouse or inventory scenarios.

Problem Statement
An urban e-commerce startup operates a warehouse that stocks and ships three product lines: Eco-friendly Gadgets, Home Decor Items, and Fitness Accessories. Each product differs in profit margin, storage requirements, handling time, and daily supply limits. The warehouse faces daily constraints on total available space, labor hours, and delivery van capacity. The business goal is to maximize total profit by deciding how many units of each product to stock and sell daily, without exceeding operational limits.

Optimization Model
The problem is formulated as a linear programming model:

Decision Variables: Number of units of each product to stock and ship per day.

Objective Function: Maximize total daily profit, calculated as the sum of profit per unit for each product times the number of units chosen.

Constraints:

Total warehouse space used cannot exceed available space.

Total labor time required for handling cannot exceed available worker hours.

Total units shipped cannot exceed the delivery van’s daily quota.

Product-specific supply limits.

All decision variables must be non-negative integers.

This model reflects real-world warehouse optimization challenges, such as those described in industry guides and logistics best practices.

Implementation and Tools Used
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Optimization Library: PuLP (for modeling and solving linear programs)

Platform: Jupyter Notebook (can be run locally via Anaconda, JupyterLab, or online via Google Colab)

Other Tools: Markdown cells for documentation and insights

The notebook guides the user through:

Business scenario and parameter setup

Mathematical model formulation

Implementation of the model using PuLP

Solution extraction and result interpretation

Business insights and recommendations

Where and How to Execute
Recommended Platform:

Google Colab (no installation needed, runs in browser)

Local Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda, JupyterLab, or VS Code with Jupyter extension)

How to Execute:

Upload the notebook to your chosen platform.

Run each cell in order. If PuLP is not installed, run !pip install pulp in a notebook cell.

Review the output and insights provided at the end.

Applications and Business Value
Warehouse optimization is a cornerstone of supply chain management. The techniques demonstrated here are applicable to:

E-commerce fulfillment centers seeking to maximize profit and efficiency.

Retailers optimizing product mix and storage under space and labor constraints.

Logistics companies managing seasonal fluctuations, delivery quotas, and resource allocation.

Any business facing the challenge of maximizing output or profit under multiple operational constraints.

By applying linear programming, businesses can make data-driven decisions that directly impact profitability, resource utilization, and customer satisfaction. The approach is scalable: more products, constraints, or objectives can be added as needed.

Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on demonstration of how mathematical optimization and Python can be used to solve real business problems in warehouse management. By structuring the problem, modeling it with PuLP, and interpreting the results, we show how modern analytics can drive smarter, more profitable operations. The notebook serves as both a practical tool and an educational resource for students and professionals in operations research, supply chain, and data science.
